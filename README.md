[jsdares](http://www.jsdares.com) is an experimental learning environment. You can learn by playing "dares" created by other users, or explore the "computational universe" on your own. If you already know programming, you can create dares and share them with the world.

All the code for jsdares was written in Javascript by Jan Paul Posma for a masters dissertation at the [University of Oxford](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk). The code is available under the MIT license, approved by both copyright holders: Jan Paul Posma and the University of Oxford (for code written before 1 October 2012). You can also view the [thesis](http://thesis.jsdares.com) online.
